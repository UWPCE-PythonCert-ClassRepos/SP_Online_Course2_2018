Excited to continue this python programming certificate program through UW

Looking forward to learning about parallelization and multithreading in python.  I've done this in other languages but not yet in python.  Also excited about furthering my skills with unit testing and working with databases.

My Background
-------------

I currently work as a Bioinformatics Scientists / Engineer working on DNA Sequence Analysis of Viral Populations.  My company develops drugs to combat many infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis C, and Hepatitis B.  My group develops data pipelines to analyze large quantities of sequencing data supporting clinical trials.  Historically, I worked mostly in perl but one year ago I made the switch to python and I am loving it!  Using this program to further my skills and efficiency in python!
