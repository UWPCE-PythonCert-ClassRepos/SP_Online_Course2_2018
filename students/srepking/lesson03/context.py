class Locke():
    """
        Write a context manager class Locke to simulate the overall functioning of the system.
        When the locke is entered it stops the pumps, opens the doors, closes the doors, and
        restarts the pumps. Likewise when the locke is exited it runs through the same steps:
        it stops the pumps, opens the doors, closes the doors, and restarts the pumps.During
        initialization the context manager class accepts the lockeâ€™s capacity in number of boats.
        Raise error if someone tries to move too many boats through the locke. Print what is
        happening with the doors and pumps.

        Too many boats through a small locke will raise an exception
        with small_locke as locke:
            locke.move_boats_through(boats)

        A Locke with sufficient capacity can move boats without incident.
